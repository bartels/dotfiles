dotfiles
========

This is my personal set of dotfiles.  Nothing special.


Installation
===========

Running `bin/install.sh` will symlink the files from "home" directory into the
user's $HOME directory.  For existing files, the user will be asked whether to
skip, or whether to back up and replace.
